# Resolving Business Questions - SQL Server Management #

This repository is inspired by a LinkedIn post by **Tajamul Khan**, who shared a collection of **50 SQL interview queries** commonly used in analytical and technical interviews.

The original questions were used as a **learning foundation**, but each query has been **adapted and enhanced** to fit the **AdventureWorks2019** sample database.  

Rather than reproducing the same examples, I expanded several queries to include **more complete business insights*.

Each query was rewritten, tested, and documented with the goal of improving both **technical SQL proficiency** and **real-world problem-solving skills**.
